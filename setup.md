This page describes setup that should preferably be done before you arrive at the course to help make the best use of your class time. The course exercises will be done on **your personal laptop** to better allow you to continue using what you learn in the course after you leave.

## Getting a Compute Canada account and cloud project

Before arriving for the course, if you can, it is strongly recommended to get a Compute Canada account and cloud project. Getting a Compute Canada account and cloud project usually takes a few business days each. Ensuring you have a Compute Canada account and cloud project at least a week before the course begins is recommended. There are two steps to getting a Compute Canada Cloud project:

### 1. Get a Compute Canada account
To get a Compute Canada account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada or know someone who is that can sponsor your Compute Canada account. To get a Compute Canada account follow the instructions provided on this [Compute Canada page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/).

### 2. Get a Compute Canada cloud project
Once you have a Compute Canada account, you then apply for a cloud project [here](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cloud#Getting_a_Cloud_project).


For those who are unable to acquire a Compute Canada Cloud project we hope to guest accounts that you can use during the course, however having your own account is preferable as you may continue to use it after the course has completed.

## Ensure you can open a terminal

The only setup required on your laptop is ensuring you can open a Linux command line terminal. For Windows users [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended. Download and install MobaXterm and verify you can run it. For Linux and Mac users you already have a terminal built in. To see how to open your terminal on your Mac see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw). If you are a Linux user running Ubuntu the first 30 seconds of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xUvH2iRizU) shows you how to access the terminal. If you are having trouble accessing a terminal on your laptop before you arrive we can help you at the beginning of the course.
