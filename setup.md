This page describes setup that should preferably be done before you arrive at the course to help make the best use of your class time. The course exercises will be done on **your personal laptop** to better allow you to continue using what you learn in the course after you leave.

## Getting a Compute Canada Cloud account

Before arriving for the course, if you can, it is strongly recommended to get a Compute Canada Cloud account. Getting an account usually takes a few business days as it is a manual process, ensuring you have a Compute Canada Cloud account at least a week before the course begins is recommended. There are two steps to getting a CC Cloud account:

1. Get a general Compute Canada account
2. Get a Compute Canada Cloud account

To get a Compute Canada account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada or be know someone who is that can sponsor your Compute Canada account. To get a Compute Canada account follow the instructions provided on this [Compute Canada page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/). Once you have a CC account, you then apply for a cloud account [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/national-services/compute-canada-cloud/create-a-cloud-account/). You will need to provide your CC account user name and an email associated with your CC account.

For those who are unable to acquire a Compute Canada Cloud account we will have guest accounts that you can use during the course, however having your own account is preferable as you may continue to use it after the course has completed.

## Ensure you can open a terminal

The only setup required on your laptop is ensuring you can open a Linux command line terminal. For Windows users [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended. Download and install MobaXterm and verify you can run it. For Linux and Mac users you already have a terminal built in. To see how to open your terminal on your Mac see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw). If you are a Linux user running Ubuntu this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_bPdG1PSg) shows you how to access the terminal. If you are having trouble accessing a terminal on your laptop before you arrive we can help you at the beginning of the course.
