This page describes setup that should preferably be done before you arrive at the course to help make the best use of your class time. The course exercises will be done on **your personal laptop** to better allow you to continue using what you learn in the course after you leave.

## Getting a Compute Canada account and cloud project

Before arriving for the course, if you can, it is strongly recommended to get a Compute Canada account and cloud project. Getting a Compute Canada account and cloud project usually takes a few business days each. Ensuring you have a Compute Canada account and cloud project at least a week before the course begins is recommended. There are two steps to getting a Compute Canada Cloud project:

### 1. Get a Compute Canada account
To get a Compute Canada account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada or know someone who is that can sponsor your Compute Canada account. To get a Compute Canada account follow the instructions provided on this [Compute Canada page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/).

### 2. Get a Compute Canada cloud project
Once you have a Compute Canada account, you (or the PI that sponsored you) will need to apply for a cloud project [here](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cloud#Getting_a_Cloud_project).

Please request a **persistent** cloud project which is well suited to running web-services. If you are unsure about what cloud resources to request for the course, the minimum possible **persistent** cloud project you can request will be sufficient for the course. If more resources are required for your projects more can be requested later as needed or now if you are confident in your requirements.

If you aren't a PI but a sponsored user, you will also need to request to be added to your PI's cloud project, again using the same form linked from [here](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cloud#Getting_a_Cloud_project).

### If you are unable to get a Compute Canada account or cloud project
If you would like a Compute Canada account but are having difficulty getting one please contact [training@computecanada.ca](mailto: training@computecanada.ca ) and we will help you get one.

For those who are unable to acquire a Compute Canada Cloud project we will provide guest accounts that you can use during the course. However, having your own project is preferable as you may continue to use it and what you have created during the course, after the course has completed.

## Ensure you can open a terminal

The only setup required on your laptop is ensuring you can open a Linux command line terminal. For Windows users [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended. Be sure to get the **Installer edition** not the portable edition. Download and install MobaXterm and verify you can run it. For Linux and Mac users you already have a terminal built in. To see how to open your terminal on your Mac see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw). If you are a Linux user running Ubuntu the first 30 seconds of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xUvH2iRizU) shows you how to access the terminal. If you are having trouble accessing a terminal on your laptop before you arrive we can help you at the beginning of the course.

### Ensure MobaXterm has a persistent home directory
If you are using Windows and MobaXterm you need to ensure you have a persistent home directory. If you got the **Installer edition** it should have already configured a persistent home directory for you, however if you got the portable edition by mistake you will need to configure a persistent home folder as outlined below.

* Open MobaXterm
* Go to MobaXterm **Settings** menu
* Select **Configuration**
* Under the **General tab** make sure you have a **Persistent home directory** set.
* If you made changes be sure to **Restart MobaXterm**
