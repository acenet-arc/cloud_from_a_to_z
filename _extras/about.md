The basis for this course presentation style and teaching paradigm was [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) a non-profit organization which runs many workshops around the world to help researchers learn the basics and best practises of computing. Lessons include topics such as the [Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [version control](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), and programing with languages such as [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/). All workshop materials are available online so they can be, to some degree self taught, though the lessons are really meant to be presented in a workshop environment. To find out about an upcoming workshop near you, see the SWC [main page](https://software-carpentry.org/) under the "Upcoming Workshops" pane.
