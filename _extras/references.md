## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
cloud computing
: A computing paradigm that enables access to shared pools of configurable computing resources.

scalability
: The ability to scale resources up as needed.

elasticity
: The ability to quickly change the amount of resources being used.

virtual machine
: An emulation of a computer system using software which runs on a real underlying computer.

IaaS
: Infrastructer as a Service is a service which provides computing infrastructure often through use of [cloud computing](#cloud-computing)

PaaS
: Platform as a Service

SaaS
: Software as a Service

hypervisor
: is computer software or hardware that creates and runs [virtual machines](#virtual-machine)

OpenStack
: open source software for creating clouds. See [cloud computing](#cloud-computing)

instance
: see [virtual machine](#virtual-machine)

virtual machine
: an emulation of a computer system and provide functionality of a physical computer.

port
: identifies a specific process or a type of network service.

LAN
: local area network is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.

IP address
: Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.

domain name
: is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control. In general, a domain name represents an [IP](#IP-address) resource.

computer network
: is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes in the network to share resources and exchange data.

hostname
: is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network

FQDN
: is a [domain name](#domain-name) that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the domain name system.

hardware virtualization
: or sometimes referred to just as virtualization is the presentation of simulated hardware by software. For example this virtual hardware could be routers, computers, or disk drives.

key pair
: a pair of cryptographic keys used in asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption uses a different key to [encrypt](#encryption) a message, in this case a [public key](#public-key), and another, in this case a [private key](#private-key), to [decrypt](#decryption) the message.

VirtualBox

Linux

encryption
: a process of transforming a message into one which is only readable by authorized parties.

decryption
: the process of transforming an [encrypted](#encryption) message into its original form before the encryption took place.

shell
: or more specifically a command-line interface is a user interface for interacting with an operating system by typing commands. A common shell is the [Bash](#bash) shell.

bash
: is a replacement for the earlier Bourne shell and is the default shell for most Linux distributions. See also [shell](#shell) for a more description of shells in general.

SSH
: is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network, commonly used for remote command execution in a [shell](#shell). It uses [key pairs](#key-pair) for authentication.
