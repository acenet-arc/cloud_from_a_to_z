## Why Jekyll?

There are a growing number of static website generators. For this workshop we have chosen [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because it has been around a while. First released in 2008 and was one of the first in new the trend of static website generators. It was also adopted by [github](https://github.com/) which is a free service for hosting **git** repositories which is very widely used. With this background we can see that Jekyll is a pretty solid project and will be supported well into the future.

What is Git? Very quickly, Git is a program that helps manage and track changes to sets of files (mainly plain text files) and facilitates parallel editing of these by many authors and later merging of these changes together. To learn more about git, Software Carpentry has an excellent lesson on [git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Fully teaching Git is beyond the scope of this workshop but it is highly recommended you look into it. If you do track changes to your website using git you can create a github repository and upload your site there and github will provide free website hosting with no need to manage a web server yourself.

Later we will look very quickly at how git and github can be used to host our Jekyll websites, but we will not dive into the gory details needed to fully understand and utilize git.

Finally these course materials you are reading now are generated by Jekyll and are hosted on github.

## How does Jekyll work?

Jekyll creates a static website (HTML, CSS, and javascript) from templates and themes (HTML, CSS, and javascript), and content written in Markdown. Once this static website is generated it can be published to the web or viewed locally in your web browser.

To create a Jekyll website you need to choose the starting theme and edit plain text files in a format called Markdown. Once you are happy with your changes, you need to generate the static website by running a command in a shell, something like:

~~~
$ jekyll build -d <web-directory>
~~~
{: .bash}

## Quick review of the shell
The shell is a program where users can type commands. These commands run programs which can do simple things like provide information about files and directories on your computer or more complex tasks such as software installation and configuration.

Start up your shell (a.k.a. a terminal) and you will see a [**prompt**](../reference#prompt). A prompt is usually some text and characters to indicate that the shell is waiting for you to enter a command. In this lesson we will use the "`$`" to indicate a prompt which is likely somewhat different from what you see in your shell.

> ## Accessing your terminal
>
> **Windows**: startup mobaXterm and then click *Start local terminal*
>
> **Mac**: search in *spotlight* for terminal click on search result *terminal*
>
> **Linux**: if using a newer version of Ubuntu try searching for *terminal* with unity's search tool (usually in the top left of the screen on the tool bar)

~~~
{: .bash}

First lets find out where we are by typing the command `pwd`, then press the Enter key to send the command to the shell. 
~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/home/cgeroux
~~~
{: .output}
More specifically, when we type `pwd` and press the Enter key, the shell:
1. finds a program called `pwd`,
2. runs that program,
3. displays that program's output, then
4. displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

The `pwd` command's output is the **present working directory**. In this case `/home/cgeroux`. This directory is known as a **home directory** where settings, files and programs for the user `cgeroux` are kept. The string `/home/cgeroux` is known as a path which indicates a specific file or directory within a file system. File systems have a tree like structure, starting at the root of the file system (`/`) and branching out from there. Each new directory creates a new branch in the file system. Directories are seperated in a path by forward slashes, `/` so that a directory inside another one can be represented like `/home` in this case, the `home` directory is inside the root directory `/`.  Adding another directory in depth to the path we have `/home/cgeroux` which is a directory inside the `home` directory.

To change your **present working directory** there is a command called `cd` for change directory. It takes one **argument** which specifies which directory to change to.
~~~
$ cd /home
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/home
~~~
{: .output}
as you can see the `pwd` command now tells you that you are in the directory `/home`. Lets now move back to our home directory. Your home directory name will be different from mine and be the output from the first execution of `pwd`.
~~~
$ cd /home/cgeroux
~~~
{: .bash}

There is a common file system layout across most Linux systems. The below figure shows an overview of some of the more relevant directories within a Linux file system for this lesson, however there are more directories than are shown here.

![file system](../fig/filesystem-truncated.svg)

* `/home`: home directories of users
* `/bin`: essential user command binaries (e.g. `ls`,`cat`,`bash`, ...)
* `/etc`: settings and configurations for the system
* `/var`: variable data files (e.g. `logs` and website data `www`)
* `/dev`: device files, (e.g. hard drive, usb, and cd-rom devices)

> ## Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it might look like `/home/cgeroux` but on windows using mobaXterm it might look like `/home/mobaxterm` or on a Mac like `/Users/cgeroux`.
{: .callout}

So far we have been using what are known as **absolute paths**. An absolute path is a path which starts with a `/` that is they start from the root of the file system. Absolute paths reference the same location no matter where they are used. There are also paths known as **relative paths** which are relative to your current working directory. These can either start with a `.` to indicate the current directory (e.g. `./Documents/pictures`), or the can just start with the directory name (e.g. `Documents/pictures`). This is different from an absolute directory which always begins with a `/`. 

In addition to the `.` shorthand for the current directory there is a `..` shorthand for parent directory of the current directory. Lets try moving up to the parent directory using a relative path using the `..` shorthand.
~~~
$ cd ..
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/home
~~~
{: .output}
Then back to our home directory.
~~~
$ cd cgeroux
~~~
{: .bash}

## Connecting to a workshop VM
We just ran some commands in our shell on our laptops, however, to work on our Jekyll websites we are going to work on a remote computer already setup on the Compute Canada cloud for us with Jekyll already installed.

We can interact with this remote computer in the same way we have been interacting with our local laptops, using a shell. To interact with a remote computer using a shell we must first connect to it using a program called `ssh`, which is short for secure shell. This command allows you to type commands as we did on our laptops but the commands are executed and affect the remote computer. It is secure because it [**encrypts**](../reference#encryption) data sent to and from the remote computer so that people intercepting these communications can not decipher them.

Before we run the `ssh` command lets take a look at the manual entry for it.
~~~
$ man ssh
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
SSH(1)                      General Commands Manual                     SSH(1)

NAME
     ssh - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

SYNOPSIS
     ssh [-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec]
         [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char]
         [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
         [-L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
         [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port]
         [-Q cipher | cipher-auth | mac | kex | key]
         [-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port]
         [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] [user@]hostname [command]
...
~~~
{: .output}

Many commands have manual pages, so executing the command `man <some-command-name>` will display information about that command, how to use it, and the options available for that command. Options for a command are specified after the command with a `-` followed directly by the option identifier for example, `-d`.

Run the `ssh` command below replacing `<username>` with the username you have been provided with for the course and `<remote-ip>` with the IP address identifying the workshop remote computer.

An IP address is a set of 4 numbers separated by `.`like `216.318.22.56`, with each number ranging between 0 and 255. IP addresses act like postal addresses to direct messages to the correct computer connected to the internet.

~~~
$ ssh <username>@<remote-ip>
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Warning: Permanently added '<remote-ip>' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
<username>@<remote-ip>'s password:
~~~
{: .output}

At the `password:` prompt enter the password you have been provided with for the course.

## Start with a theme

Lets create our first site using a pre-made custom theme so it looks nicer than the built in standard Jekyll theme. There are a number of places to find Jekyll themes:

* [jamstackthemes.dev](http://jamstackthemes.dev)
* [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org)
* [jekyllthemes.io](http://jekyllthemes.io)
* [jekyll-themes.com](http://jekyll-themes.com)

I found one I like on [jekyllthemes.io](http://jekyllthemes.io), called [Forty](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/forty-jekyll-theme), lets use this theme.

To use it we need to download it onto our VM. In order to do that we need to get a URL to download it from. A little bit lower on the page there is a link that says "Get Forty on GitHub". If we click that it will take us to the theme's github page. We can get a download URL from there by clicking the "Code" drop down box, right clicking on the "Download ZIP" link and selecting "Copy link address".

Now we can download it to our VM by using the <code>wget</code> command and pasting the link we copied to our clip board into our SSH terminal on our VM. Then unzip the newly downloaded file with the `unzip` command and change into that directory.
<!--TODO: might want to mv the unzipped directory to a new name that is more meaning for their site?-->
~~~
$ wget https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd forty-jekyll-theme-master
~~~
{: .bash}

<!--
> ## Gem based themes
> Gem based themes can be installed like regular Ruby gems using the `gem` command. Gem based themes will hide much of the themes styling and layouts in a separate directory for the gem. Only the directories and files required to add content your site are present in the sites directory.
{: .callout}
-->

There are a few minor configuration settings we have to make in order for that theme to work with our web-server. Configuration settings for Jekyll sites are generally in the `_config.yml` file. This is a YAML file (YAML Ain't Markup Language) (see: [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/)). Very briefly, a YAML file is a way of specifying key value pairs in a standardized format so that computer programs and people can easily read them. These key value pairs have a format like `key``:``value`, where the key name and it's value are separated by a colon, `:`. In addition, lines which begin with a `#` are comment lines. These lines add useful information for people reading and editing these YAML files but are usually ignored by programs reading these files.

~~~
$ nano _config.yml
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
# site settings
title: Forty
.
.
.
baseurl: "/forty-jekyll-theme" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
.
.
.
~~~
{: .output}
To have the site generate correctly we only need to change one value, for the key: `baseurl`. This value tells the site how to find things within its own site. Initially this has the value `/forty-jekyll-theme`. This tells the site that it is located in the directory "forty-jekyll-theme" in the root directory of our web site. In our case our root web directory is `/var/www/html` on our VM and each user has their own directory named after their username. For example `user01` would have their website at `/var/www/html/user01`. So we need to set the key `baseurl` to be your username. For example if you logged on with `user01` you would want to set `baseurl` to be `user01`. After editing the `_config.yml` file it should look like this:
~~~
# site settings
title: Forty
.
.
.
baseurl: "/<your-username>" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
.
.
.
~~~
{: .output}

with the username you logged in with instead of `/<your-username>`

Then save the and exit the editor by pressing `^` (control) and `x` keys simultaneously. This will ask if you want to "Save modified buffer?" to which you answer `Y` for yes. It will then check to see if you want use the same file name, which we do, so press `return` or `enter` to confirm. You should now be back at the command prompt.

Use the following command to publish it to our web-server's root directory.
~~~
$ jekyll build -d /var/www/html/<your-username>
~~~
{: .bash}

<!--
If the needed gems for the theme haven't been installed yet, will need to run:
~~~
$ bundle install
~~~
{: .bash}
-->

This command generates the site from the contents of the current working directory and places the newly created site in the `/var/www/html/<your-username>` directory.

Finally visit your new site at your VM's IP address in your browser with your username appended (e.g. `/user01`) to see your new Jekyll site.

<!--
> ## Gemfiles and gemspec
> Bundler uses Gemfiles to specify where to download gems using a line starting with <code>source</code> with the URL to download the gems from afterwards. This line is followed by lines listing the names of the gems to install. Sometimes Gemfiles specify the requirements in separate files ending with ".gemspec". This is indicated by a line <code>gemspec</code> in the Gemfile. Gemspec files are used to specify attributes and requirements for gems. You can read more about Bundler Gemfiles [here](https://bundler.io/gemfile.html), and about the use of <code>gemspec</code> in Gemfiles [here](https://bundler.io/rubygems.html).

> ## Automatically rebuild your site when files are updated
> The jekyll `build` command can be run with a `-w` option. This option will keep this command running in the terminal watching for any files to change. If it notices one change, it will automatically rebuild your site. This can be very handy when performing many frequent edits. The complete command might look like:
>~~~
>$ jekyll build -w -d <website_root_directory>
