In this episode we will install and configure an [**Apache Web Server**](https://httpd.apache.org/). This is free, open source software that is developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation and is one of the most widely used web server platforms on the Internet. While most websites use Apache there are alternatives such as [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) which can provide better performance in cases where a VM is running a single website.

## Installing the Apache web server package

Lets install the Apache web server (or HTTP server) package on our VM. To do this we can use the `apt` command but this time with the sub command `install`. This command however  requires a specific package name. To find a specific package name we can search through the packages with the `search` sub command for `apt`.

<!--## Backing up configuration files

Before make any changes to a packages configuration files it is best practise to make a backup of the files. If we make any grievous errors we can return the configuration file back to its original state. This is particularly helpful in the event that we delete information which should never have been removed. One strategy is to create a folder in your home directory and call it `ORIG`. The contents of this directory will represent the original state of files and directories in the root directory `/`. Back up all of your configuration files here and preserve the original paths. In this way the path under the `ORIG` directory will correspond to the path in the `/` directory.

To create the `ORIG` directory in your home directory on the VM use the `mkdir` command which makes a new directory with the options `-pv`. The `p` option will create additional "parent" directories in the path given, if they do not exist. The `v` option will cause the `mkdir` command to be more verbose telling you about all the directories it creates. In our case we want to copy Apache's configuration which is in the `/etc/apache2` directory. To match the path in root we will also create an `etc` directory inside the `ORIG` directory.
~~~
$ mkdir -pv ~/ORIG/etc
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
mkdir: created directory '/home/ubuntu/ORIG'
mkdir: created directory '/home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc'
~~~
{: .output}

Next we will use the `cp` command to copy the entire contents of the Apache configuration to the `~/ORIG/etc` directory. We will also use the `-a`, or archive, option to preserver permissions, ownership, and timestamp of the files. To allow the preservation of these file attributes correctly administrative permissions are required, thus we use `sudo` to run the `cp` command.
~~~
$ sudo cp -av /etc/apache2 /home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
'/etc/apache2' -> '/home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc/apache2'
'/etc/apache2/sites-enabled' -> '/home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc/apache2/sites-enabled'
'/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf' -> '/home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf'
.
.
.
'/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf' -> '/home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf'
'/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf' -> '/home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf'
~~~
{: .output}
What the copy command did was copy the contents of the `apache2` directory, and all subdirectories, to the /home/ubuntu/ORIG/etc directory. Now we can perform configuration modifications in `/etc/apache2` without worrying about making mistakes as we can just restore settings from our copied files.

## Configure a global ServerName

If a global `ServerName` is not configured, Apache will issue a warning message when the configuration files are read. This will happen when you restart your web server or if you check the configuration files. The command `apache2ctl` is used to control the apache web server. It does things like start and stop the web server, report status, and more. The subcommand `configtest` is used to test configuration files for syntax errors and will issue the warning message when executed:

~~~
$ sudo apache2ctl configtest
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message
Syntax OK
~~~
{: .output}

We are going to set the ServerName variable to be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for our virtual machine. The `host` command, given our Floating IP address, will provide us with the FQDN.
~~~
host 206.167.181.126
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
126.181.167.206.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer 206-167-181-126.cloud.computecanada.ca.
~~~
{: .output}

So the FQDN for the virtual machine is `206-167-181-126.cloud.computecanada.ca`. Use this to set the `ServerName` in the configuration file `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
~~~
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
~~~
{: .bash}
then scroll down to the bottom and add the line`ServerName 206-167-181-126.cloud.computecanada.ca`. The press the ctrl+x keys to exit, making sure to save the edits back to the original file. Then check the configuration files for syntax errors.
~~~
sudo apache2ctl configtest
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Syntax OK
~~~
{: .output}

The command `systemctl` is used to control services running on a Ubuntu system. Restart the **apache2** service to enable our changes using the subcommand `restart` and providing the name of the service we want to restart `apache`.
~~~
sudo systemctl restart apache2
~~~
{: .bash}

Using the `systemctl` command again with a different sub command `status` will tell use the status of the named service.
~~~
sudo systemctl status apache2
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~

## Add Security Rule for HTTP

HTTP uses port 80 so we need to add it to our default security group as we did with the SSH port 22. However, in this case we don't need to restrict it to a specific IP address as we want anyone to be able to see our website.

## Visit the default web page

The apache package installs a default web page to test the installation. This page provides basic information about your apache installation and some tips about how you might modify apache's configuration to suite your needs. Start your web browser and enter your VM's public IP address into the adress bar `206.12.11.12`. You should see something like the image below.

<img src="../fig/web-screens/ubuntu_default_web_page.png" alt="Ubuntu Default Web Page"/>

To create your own web pages you may edit the file `/var/www/html/index.html` which is the default web page shown above. You can use HTML, CSS, and more to create web pages (see [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for tutorials and references for creating web pages with these technologies).


<!-- > ## Static web pages
> At this point you have all the server setup required to start creating [**static websites**](../reference#static-website). By static website I mean that the contents of the site are display as they are stored on the server. Every visitor of the site sees the same site. For example, this workshop site was generated using a static website generator called [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is integrated with [github](../reference#github) (a version control web tool). That isn't to say a static website can't have dynamic components. A static website can have features which change based on actions, such as menus which are animated or expandable challenge boxes as shown below. What they can't do is display information which is specific to a person visiting the site, such as shopping carts or account information. Some of the major benefits of static websites is simplicity of setup and maintenance, improved security, and improved performance. If you don't require the functionality of a dynamic site I would highly recommend investigating some of the various static site generators out there. For a good list see: [www.staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/)

> ## Domain names
> In this course we use the public IP address to connect to our VMs through SSH and our web browsers. It is possible to associate this public IP with a domain name using a domain name registrar. Some popular domain name registrars are [rebel.ca](https://www.rebel.ca/) and [godaddy.com](https://ca.godaddy.com/) but there are many others. After you purchase a domain name, often for something like $10-20 per year, you can register your public IP with your domain name. These domain name registrars will then forward requests for your domain name to your VM having the registered public IP address.

> ## HTTPS
> HTTPS is HTTP Secure, many websites use HTTPS to encrypt data sent between a users web browser and their web-server. This is particularly important for websites which handle passwords and other private information such as credit cards. However, it is also possible for data sent from a web-server to be intercepted and modified before the website user receives it. This is true for any website and as such it is a good idea to use HTTPS rather than HTTP. To setup HTTPS however, requires your site to use a domain name rather than an IP address. To setup HTTPS on your site you must create and register a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, or more recently updated to a TLS or Transport Layer Security) certificate with a third party signing authority. These third party signing authorities will verify that the site a user gets is indeed the site that was registered with that third party signing authority. So this provides more security than simply encrypting data sent to and from a web-server. Many third party signing authorities charge money for registering SSL certificates however [**letsencrypt**](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free third party signing authority. There is also a program which you can download and install which will create the certificate for you, register it with letsencrypt and adjust your web server configuration to use the certificate and server HTTPS called [**certbot**](https://certbot.eff.org/). With the ease with which you can setup HTTPS there is almost no reason not to always use it for your sites.
