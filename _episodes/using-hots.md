In this episode we will learn how to perform automated cloud environment orchestration using Heat Orchestration Templates (HOT).

HOTs are YAML files describing the configuration of a stack of resources in your OpenStack project including virtual machines, floating IP address, volumes, and security rules. HOTs can be combined with cloud-init to perform the initial setup on newly created virtual machines. We will use a pre-made MediaWiki HOT [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgeroux/heat-mediawiki/master/heat.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgeroux/heat-mediawiki/master/heat.yaml). 

This HOT does the following:

* Creates a volume.
* Creates a VM booting from the volume.
  * Passes in a cloud-init script to setup MediaWiki software with settings provided by us.
* Allocate a new floating IP.
  * Associate it with VM
* Create a new security group
  * Add rule for SSH
  * Add rule for HTTP
  * Add rule for HTTPS

To use a HOT go to the Orchestration drop down and select *stacks*. A stack, in this context, is a group of OpenStack resources and you can create a new *stack* using a HOT. To do so click on *Launch Stack* brining up a *Select Template* dialogue. This is where you tell OpenStack the template to use to create your stack. To use the MediWiki HOT select *URL* from the *Template Source* drop down and copy and paste the above URL into the *Template URL* text box. Then click the *next* button which will bring up a dialogue to enter various parameters used to customize the stack and software setup.

Beside each of the parameters is a "?" which when you hover over it will provide a description of the parameter and perhaps some guidance on what should be chosen. We will use the following settings:
* **Stack Name**: &lt;your-name&gt;-media-wiki-stack 
* **Creation Timeout**: leave default 60 minutes
* **Wiki Name**: &lt;your wiki name&gt;
* **Wiki administrator**: &lt;your-username&gt;
* **Enable uploads**: check the box
* **Wiki Logo URL**: leave as the default.
* **MediaWiki Version**: Leave as the default *1.27*
* **Mediawiki Patch**: lave as the default *0*
* **Falvor**: *p1-1.5gb*
* **Image**: *ubuntu-server-14.04-amd64*
* **Key-pair name**: &lt;name-of-keypair-used-to-ssh-to-vm&gt;
* **Volume Name**: &lt;your-name&gt;-mediawiki_root
* **Volume Size**: 10 GB
* **Private network name or ID**: &lt;your-project-name&gt;_network
* **Public Network**: select *VLAN3337*
* **Enable SSL**: check the box
* **Read permission**: leave as default *user*
* **Edit permission**: leave as default *user*
* **Account creation permission**: leave as default *sysop*

Once you *launch* the new stack, you can click on the *Stack Name* for more details on your stack. The first screen you are presented with is the ''Topology'' tab shown below.
![Topology](../fig/os-screens/Stack-Topology.png)

This tab shows an overview of the components created by the HOT and their status. Once you see that the creation has completed, take a look at the *Overview* tab. Of particular interest on this tab is the *Outputs* section. This section lists outputs spefic to the HOT used. In our case of the media-wiki HOT it lists the public IP of the VM, how to get administrative account info (e.g. username/password) and a link to the wiki.
![Topology](../fig/os-screens/Stack-Overview.png)

Lets look up our username and password by going to *Compute*->*Instances* and clicking on the name of our mediawiki VM (hint it will be named after your stack). Then select the *Log* tab. You may need to wait until the setup of the VM completes which may take several minutes. Once it is done you should see a line like:

~~~
loud-init v. 0.7.5 finished at Mon, 16 Apr 2018 17:47:28 +0000. Datasource DataSourceOpenStack [net,ver=2].  Up 232.29 seconds
~~~
{: .output}

Above that you will see the <code>Wiki Admin Username:</code> and <code>Wiki Admin password:</code> fields which you can use to log into your newly created mediawiki VM.

Because the HOT uses self signed SSL certificates, you will see a warning such as **Your connection is not private**. This indicates that the validity of your server's SSL certificate can not be verified against a recognized signing authority. That makes sense since we didn't register it with one. You can safely advance to your mediawiki server and the communications will be encrypted. In

* **Firefox** click on *Advanced* -> *Add Exception...* -> *Confirm Security Exception*
* **Edge** click on *Details* -> *Go on to the webpage*
