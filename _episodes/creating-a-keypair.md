Now that you have an overview of OpenStack and have clicked around the dashboard it is time to create our first virtual machine. To create a virtual machine, we would click the "Launch Instance" button on the Instances panel, but before we do that there is at least one thing which we need to take care of first and that is, create a key to access our newly created virtual machine. The key will allow only the person possessing it to access the VM. Before we create a virtual machine we need to select a key to be injected into it which we can use to access the virtual machine.

Before we create a virtual machine we need to think about how we will access and use it. When you use your laptop or desktop computer you have a graphical interface which you click around and windows you type in to get your computer to do what you want. You might not know it but you can also run a terminal or **shell** program and type **commands** to get your computer to do things. The things done in the shell in some cases can be seen in the graphical interface. For example you can use the shell to create directories and files which you can see in a graphical file system viewer (e.g. Windows Explorer or Finder). We will use the shell to interact with our virtual machines. 

There is a shell called **Secure Shell** or **SSH** for short which is used to make remote connections between machines allowing one to execute commands on a remote machine. SSH encrypts information sent between your local computer and a remote computer using a shared key. Encryption is a way of transforming text or data which is readable and understandable by anyone into text and data which is only understandable if one posses the key. SSH authentication keys (different from the shared key used to encode the messages) come in pairs, one public and one private. The public key is used to encrypt a message which contains the shared key that can only be decoded by the owner of the private key. In this way the machine sending a message encoded using the public key can be sure that the machine responding has the private key which can decode the message in this way the key pair can be used to authenticate the user. A shared key sent in the message allows the two machines to send and receive sensitive information which only they can decode.

Lets make a pair of SSH authentication keys we can use to connect to our virtual machines. Start up your shell (a.k.a. a terminal) and you will see a **prompt**. A prompt is usually some text and characters to indicate that the shell is waiting for you to enter a command. In this lesson we will use the "`$`" to indicate a prompt which is likely somewhat different from what you see in your shell.

~~~
$
~~~
{: .bash}

First lets find out where we are by typing the command `pwd`, then press the Enter key to send the command to the shell. 
~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/home/cgeroux
~~~
{: .output}
More specifically, when we type `pwd` and press the Enter key, the shell:
1. finds a program called `pwd`,
2. runs that program,
3. displays that program's output, then
4. displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

The `pwd` command's output is the **present working directory**. In this case `/home/cgeroux`. This directory known as a **home directory** where settings, files and programs for the user `cgeroux` are kept. The string `/home/cgeroux` is known as a path which indicates a specific file or directory within a file system. File systems have a tree like structure, starting at the root of the file system (`/`) and branching out from there. Each new directory creates a new branch in the file system. Directories are seperated in a path by forward slashes, `/` so that a directory inside another one can be represented like `/home` in this case, the `home` directory is inside the root directory `/`.  Adding another directory in depth to the path we have `/home/cgeroux` which is a directory inside the `home` directory.

To change your **present working directory** there is a command called `cd` for change directory. It takes one **argument** which specifies which directory to change to.
~~~
$ cd /home
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/home
~~~
{: .output}
as you can see the `pwd` command now tells you that you are in the directory `/home`. Lets now move back to our home directory. Your home directory name will be different from mine and be the output from the first execution of `pwd`.
~~~
$ cd /home/cgeroux
~~~
{: .bash}

There is a common file system layout across most Linux systems. The below figure shows an overview of some of the more relevant directories within a Linux file system for this lesson, however there are more directories than are shown here.

![file system](../fig/filesystem-truncated.svg)

* `/home`: home directories of users
* `/bin`: essential user command binaries (e.g. `ls`,`cat`,`bash`, ...)
* `/etc`: settings and configurations for the system
* `/var`: variable data files (e.g. `logs` and website data `www`)
* `/dev`: device files, (e.g. hard drive, usb, and cd-rom devices)

> ## Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it might look like `/home/cgeroux` but on windows using mobaXterm it might look like `/home/mobaxterm` or on a Mac like `/Users/cgeroux`.
{: .callout}

So far we have been using what are known as **absolute paths**. An absolute path is a path which starts with a `/` that is they start from the root of the file system. Absolute paths reference the same location no matter where they are used. There are also paths known as **relative paths** which are relative to your current working directory. These can either start with a `.` to indicate the current directory (e.g. `./Documents/pictures`), or the can just start with the directory name (e.g. `Documents/pictures`). This is different from an absolute directory which always begins with a `/`.

Lets try moving up to the parent directory using a relative path.
~~~
$ cd ..
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/home
~~~
{: .output}
Then back to our home directory.
~~~
$ cd cgeroux
~~~
{: .bash}

The command to create a new key pair is `ssh-keygen` but before we run it lets have a look at the manual pages for the command by typing
~~~
$ man ssh-keygen
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
SSH-KEYGEN(1)                                  BSD General Commands Manual                                 SSH-KEYGEN(1)

NAME
     ssh-keygen â€” authentication key generation, management and conversion

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-keygen [-q] [-b bits] [-t dsa | ecdsa | ed25519 | rsa | rsa1] [-N new_passphrase] [-C comment]
                [-f output_keyfile]
     ssh-keygen -p [-P old_passphrase] [-N new_passphrase] [-f keyfile]
     ssh-keygen -i [-m key_format] [-f input_keyfile]
     ssh-keygen -e [-m key_format] [-f input_keyfile]
     ssh-keygen -y [-f input_keyfile]

{: .output}
Many commands have manual pages, so executing the command `man <some-command-name>` will display information about that command, how to use it, and the options available for that command. Options for a command are specified after the command with a `-` followed directly by the option identifier for example, `-a`. If you scroll down the manual pages (by pressing the down arrow key) and read the description, you will notice that this command creates a key in the `~/.ssh` directory. The `~` is a synonym for your home directory (e.g. `/home/cgeroux`) and the `.` at the beginning of the directory name indicates that the directory or file is hidden. The command `ls` is used to list the file structure, or in other words list files and directories inside a directory given as an argument to the command. If no argument is given `ls` will list the files and directories inside the current directory. Hidden files will not be shown by the `ls` command unless the `-a` option is used. 

Lets check to see if you have a `.ssh` folder already in your home directory.
~~~
$ ls -a ~
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
.                         .bashrc                  .viminfo
..                        .gitconfig                Desktop
.aptcyg                   .python_history           LauncherFolder
.bash_history             .ssh                      MyDocuments
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that in addition to the hidden directory `.ssh` we also have hidden directories `.` and `..` as well as others. The `.` and `..` are special directories. The double dot is a shortcut for the parent directory, or the directory which contains your home directory. The single dot is a shortcut for the directory its self, your home directory, as was mentioned when talking about relative paths. The single dot can be used to reference the current directory by starting the path with a `.` (e.g. `./MyDocuments`).

If you do have a `.ssh` folder, have a look inside.
~~~
$ ls ~/.ssh/
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
id_rsa       id_rsa.pub   known_hosts
~~~
{: .output}
Notice that the a forward `/` is used to separate directories. In this case the `.ssh` directory is inside the home directory `~` (or in this case `/home/cgeroux`). If you have a pair of files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` or `id_dsa` and `id_dsa.pub` you already have a key pair and you can skip the next steps which create a new key pair and just use the key pair you already have.

To create a key pair run the command
~~~
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cgeroux/.ssh/id_rsa):
~~~
{: .output}
It is asking where to store the keypair, in this case lets just use the default location by pressing the `<return>` key. Then you will get
~~~
Created directory '/home/cgeroux/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
~~~
{: .output}
at which point you should enter a passphrase which will be required to 'unlock' the private key. A passphrase is different from a password in that it can contain multiple words. The longer the passphrase the better, though at some point it gets a pain to type frequently.
~~~
Enter same passphrase again:
~~~
{: .output}
then reneter the passphrase and
~~~
Your identification has been saved in /home/cgeroux/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/cgeroux/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:WKM/Rx7bBCqPH7DLuXww3xnu0YqL+H1enJHFER1zt/4 cgeroux@Caelia
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|              o=+|
|             . .*|
|        o .   o. |

{: .output}
now you have a key pair saved in the `.ssh` folder we can use with the cloud. To
verify lets take a look in the folder
~~~
$ ls ~/.ssh/
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
id_rsa      id_rsa.pub
~~~
{: .output}

This key pair consists of the private key (the file `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and a public key (the file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). You can have a look at the contents of the key files using an editor or a command called `cat` which just prints the contents of a file to the terminal.
~~~
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~

Your public key can be given out freely, but remember to keep your private key secret. One final thing I would like to point out about keys is their file permissions. Run the command `ls` command with the `-l` option to show the permissions on the files inside the `.ssh` folder.
~~~
$ ls -l ~/.ssh/
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
-rw-r--r--    1 cgeroux  UsersGrp      1766 Mar 31 15:12 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--    1 cgeroux  UsersGrp       396 Mar 31 15:12 id_rsa.pub
~~~
{: .output}
The file permissions are displayed in the far left column. Possible file permissions are `r` for read, `w` for write, and `x` for execute. You will notice the dashes which indicate unset permissions. The first `-` will be a `d` if the item is a directory next followed by the three permissions (rwx) for the user who owns the file (in this case the user `cgeroux`). Next are the permissions for the group the file belongs to (in this case `UsersGrp` users and files can belong to groups) and finally the permissions for everyone else. In this case you can see that the private key `id_rsa` is actually readable by any user on this computer. Since you should keep your private key private it is good practise to set the permissions on this file to be readable only by the owner of the file. This can be done using the `chmod` command.
~~~
$ chmod og-r ~/.ssh/id_rsa
~~~
{: .bash}
The above command will remove (`-`) read (`r`) permissions for others (`o`) and members of the file's group (`g`). You can also specify changes in permissions for the user which owns the file with `u` and add permissions by using a `+` instead of the `-` as well as specify multiple permissions at once (e.g. `chmod u+rwx <file-name>`).

Issuing the `ls` command again shows the changes to the permissions.
~~~
$ ls -l ~/.ssh
~~~ 
{: .bash}
~~~
total 3
-rw-------    1 cgeroux  UsersGrp      1766 Mar 31 15:12 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--    1 cgeroux  UsersGrp       396 Mar 31 15:12 id_rsa.pub
~~~
{: .output}
However while mobaXterm appears much like a fully functioning Linux terminal there are some limitations. For example this chmod command does not always have an effect. However, on Mac and Linux machines the correct result should be observed. The `.ssh` directory should also have restricted permissions so that only the owner has read permissions.
~~~
$ chmod og-rx ~/.ssh
$ ls -al ~/

If these permissions are too open the command we use to connect between computers may complain. 
> ## File permissions variations
>
> In the case of mobaXterm the `ssh` command does not require strict permissions, however on Linux machines or Macs the `ssh` command does require stricter permissions before it will allow you to connect using a private key. In addition depending on the details of your windows operating system and version of mobaXterm you may or may not actually be able to change file permissions wihtin mobaXterm.

Now we have a key pair we can use to connect to our the VM we will create in the next episode.
