## Introductions
Lets get to know each other starting with introductions and a brief background about your self. Tell us why you are interested in this course and what you hope to get out of it.

## Use cases
Cloud computing offers a wide range of usage possibilities. From running basic HTML sites for publishing works, to collaborative wikis, to running persistent twitter/web scrapers automating data collection and processing, to providing platforms to help support whole research communities. Possible use cases are varied and wide ranging. One particular example using the Compute Canada cloud is [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), a web-based text reading and analysis environment. It is a scholarly project that is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practises for digital humanities students and scholars as well as for the general public.

## Motivation
Humanities and social sciences often make use of computers in varied and diverse ways typically not needed by the more traditional high performance computing tasks. Cloud computing provides the required flexibility for these varied and diverse usage cases. However, this flexibility comes at a cost. To facilitate a wide array possible use cases, much of the configuration and setup must be undertaken by individual researchers and not by the central bodies which manage the cloud infrastructure. With each cloud setup being customized and unique it becomes difficult to manage centrally in a consistent manner and much of the management and customization is left to the end cloud user.

## Overview
This course will start by introducing some basic concepts about the Internet and cloud in general to lay the foundation for the episodes to come. By the end of the first half of the course you should have the basic tools and knowledge in hand to start working with the cloud, having created a web-server and your first website hosted on your own cloud server.

In second half of the course we will use Jekyll as an example of how to setup and use a static website generator to create a website with a theme selected from one of the many Jekyll theme repositories. We will walk through the steps to configure your website and how to explore our downloaded theme in order to use it. We will use Markdown to format text and include links and images in our pages. We will even use a little HTML in our markdown to embed a youtube video in one of the pages of our site. Finally we will wrap up with where you can learn more about making websites with Jekyll.

Before we begin make sure you have completed the steps in the [setup](../setup) page. If you have had difficulty with any part of them, now is the time to let us know and we will help you solve them.
