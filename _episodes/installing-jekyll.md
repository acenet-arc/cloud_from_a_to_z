In the previous episode I mentioned a number of static website systems, the systems I mentioned generate static websites from content you provide and are referred to as static website generators. Generally the content you provided is in the form of a text file in some format. Different static website generators have different formats they know how to read and convert into static websites. In this workshop we are going to be using the static website generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which reads plain text files written in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format. We will look at the syntax of Markdown files shortly, but first lets install Jekyll on our webserver and create our first Jekyll website.

## Prerequisits
These are Ubuntu software packages which Jekyll needs to run.

* **[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)**: is a programming language. This Ubuntu software package installs tools required to create and run Ruby programs. Jekyll is written in Ruby, so this is a definite requirement.
* **build-essentials**: this Ubuntu software package includes gcc, g++, make and a few commonly used software libraries. These are the [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html) C and C++ compilers.
* **[zlib](https://zlib.net/)**: compression library.

## Configure Ruby to install gems to your home directory
Ruby has its own packaging system for distributing Ruby libraries or plug-ins. One of these packages is referred to as a **Gem**. It is advisable to install these Ruby Gems into your own personal directory space. This can be beneficial if other users on the VM wish to install conflicting versions of Gems.

> ## Why would you want different versions of Gems?
> If you want to customize your Jekyll site different themes and plugins can depend on different versions of Gems. By installing Gems into a folder in your home directory you will not interfere with other people's Gems.

There is a special file in your home directory `.bashrc` which contains a list of commands that are run in your new shell just before you get your first command prompt. This file is used for setting special configuration options you might like to have set in your shell. We are going to edit this file and add two commands to set a setting to tell Ruby where to install Gems, and one to set a setting to tell our shell where to find new commands provided by these newly installed Gems. In our case we want to install the Gems into a directory `gems` in our home directory rather than a system directory owned by the `root` user. Lets edit our `.bashrc` file with nano.

Nano is a text editor you can use from within a shell. When you run the `nano file_name` command it will open up the specified file for editing. It will display the contents of the file in your shell and you can type in text to create the contents of the file. Along the bottom of the terminal screen nano lists commands you can run, like `Exit`, by pressing the `Ctrl` and `X` keys. The `ctrl` key is represented with the `^` character.

~~~
$ nano ~/.bashrc
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
      *) return;;
esac
.
.
.
~~~
{: .bash}
There are many lines of commands in here that likely don't make a lot of sense to you at this point, however, we don't need to worry about them as we want to add a couple extra  commands to the bottom of this file to configure where Ruby installs Gems and leave the rest of it untouched. Use the down arrow to scroll down to the bottom of the file and enter the following lines of text.
~~~
# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems
export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"
export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"
~~~
{: .output}

The first line that we entered beginning with a `#` is a comment line. Meaning it isn't a command we want executed when we login, but rather some text to tell us about what the following commands are for. The two lines following the comment beginning with an `export` are setting two variables that Ruby and our shell use to locate things. The first `export` line sets a setting telling Ruby where to install gems. In this case we want it in a `gems` directory in our home directory, `$HOME`. `$HOME` is replaced with the current users home directory, in our case it will be `/home/ubuntu`. The second `export` command is telling our shell where to look to find new commands provided by the gems we install. The `PATH` setting is a list of directories separated by a `:` that our shell should look in for commands we are trying to execute. In this case we are adding the `$HOME/gems/bin` directory to the beginning of the list so it will look in this directory first for any commands we try to execute and then all of the usually places already listed in the `PATH` setting. The `$` character allows you to reference the current value of a setting, for example the `$HOME` setting value, or the `$PATH` setting value.

Now that we have those lines added, lets save and exit our editor. For those new settings to take effect without having to `exit` and `ssh` back into our VM we can use the `source` command, which will read through a file and run the commands listed in it.
~~~
$ source ~/.bashrc
~~~
{: .bash}

## Install Jekyll and Bundler gems
Jekyll is a Ruby Gem and can be installed with Ruby's package manager. Bundler is another Gem which aids in installing gems required by Ruby projects. Often when installing new Jekyll themes and plugins it is easiest to use Bundler to install the required Gems for those themes and plugins.
~~~
$ gem install jekyll bundler
~~~
{: .bash}

<!--Note sure I need this. Some themes I tried needed to have a newer version
of bundler, but other's do not. Maybe this should be a "break out" or something?

update bundler
~~~
$ bundle update --bundler
~~~
{: .bash}
-->

## Create and configure a group to edit your website
Currently the default web root directory `/var/www/html` of your website is only editable by the root user. This means that any user that wants to edit files in that directory must first append all commands to modify those files with the `sudo` command. This gets tedious and there is not security reason not to have these files editable by users other than root. To do this we will create a new user group `webeditor` and add the default `ubuntu` user we are logged in as to this group.

Before we create our new group, lets verify that there isn't already a group with this name used for some other purpose. To check current list of user groups look in the file `/etc/groups`. We can use the `cat` command to view this file without editing it.
~~~
$ cat /etc/group
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
root:x:0:
daemon:x:1:
bin:x:2:
sys:x:3:
.
.
.
~~~
{: .output}
If we scrool through that list it appears we are safe. There is no group already called `webeditor`.

To create a new user group we can use the command `addgroup`
~~~
$ sudo addgroup webeditor
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Adding group `webeditor' (GID 1001) ...
Done.
~~~
{: .output}

Next we will use the `chown` command to change the group which the root directory of our website belongs too to be our new group and then verify that our change took place. The `chown` command has the following form `chown user:group path`, where `user` and `group` are the new user and group for the file or directory specified by `path`.
~~~
$ sudo chown root:webeditor /var/www/html
$ ls -l /var/www
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 34 root webeditor 4096 Sep 17 16:00 html
~~~
{: .output}

As can be seen in the permissions listed in above output, these files aren't actually writable by their group. Lets use the <code>chmod</code> command to change that.
~~~
$ sudo chmod g+w /var/www/html
$ ls -al /var/www
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
total 4
drwxrwxr-x 34 root webeditor 4096 Sep 17 16:00 html
~~~
{: .output}

When new files are created in the `html` folder, they will be owned by the user who created them, but they will also be in the user's default group, which is the same as the username of the user. This means that other user's in the `webeditor` group wouldn't be able to edit these files or directories, even though they are in the `webeditor` group. To fix this we can set the

> To create a new user issue the following command and replace `USERNAME` with the username you want the new user to have.

>
> If you want this user to be able to install software or other administrative tasks you will want to give them permission to use the `sudo` command. It is generally a good security practice to limit the number of people who have administrative privileges, so give it some thought before you grant these permission to others. You can grant other users the ability to use the `sudo` command by editing a file with a special editor called `visudo`. This editor helps prevent errors in the file from removing everyone from being able to use the `sudo` command, which would actually prevent you from being able to fix the situation as editing that file requires the `sudo` command. To grant a user access to the `sudo` command run the following command to start editing the file listing sudo users

Lets remove the default landing page that our apache2 installation put in this folder so that when we create our new website with Jekyll it can write a new `index.html` file here without having to be run as the root user to overwrite the existing `index.html` file. To remove a file you use the `rm` command followed by the path to the file you wish to remove.
~~~
$ sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
~~~
{: .bashrc}

The last step is to add our current user to the `webeditor` group. To do this we can use the `adduser` command which can be used to add an existing user to a new group.
~~~
$ sudo adduser ubuntu webeditor
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Adding user `ubuntu' to group `webeditor' ...
Adding user ubuntu to group webeditor
Done.
~~~
{: .output}

For this change to tack effect, disconnect and reconnect for the new group membership to take effect.
~~~
$ exit
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
$ ssh ubuntu@206.12.11.12
