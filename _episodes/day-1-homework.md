So far we have been working on a remote computer already setup for us in the Compute Canada cloud to create and publish our website. However, this will become unavailable after the workshop and is meant only as a temporary learning environment and not a permanent solution for publishing your website.

There are a couple different options available for more permanent solutions which we will talk about in this workshop, one of which is hosting your site on github.

# Get a github account

On our next session we will spend one episode walking through how to host your Jekyll site on github. Github provides free git repository hosting and can also be used as a free Jekyll site hosting option. We will get into the details of what all that means next time.

But, if you would like to following along in the episode where we walk through how to host your website on github please create a new github account by **going to [github.com](https://github.com/) and clicking "Sign up"** before we meat again. **Keep track of what email you use to sign up as you will need to know that while we work through the lesson.**
