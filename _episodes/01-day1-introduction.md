Lets get to know each other starting with introductions and a brief background about your self. Tell use why you are interested in this course and what you hope to get out of it.

This course will start by introducing some basic concepts about the Internet and cloud in general to lay the foundation for the episodes to come. By the end of the first day you should have the basic tools and knowledge in hand to start working with the cloud, having created a web-server and your first website hosted on your own cloud server.

In day two we will use WordPress as an example of how to setup and configure more complex website software.  WordPress is a content management systems (CMS). There are many different CMSs available which have many components in common. We will start with manually walking through the steps to create a WordPress site in the cloud. Understanding the manual steps of installing and configuring a CMS will allow you to generalize to other CMS systems for example wikimedia, omeka, and drupal. Day two will also cover some more advanced ways to interact with the cloud using your terminal.

In day 3, with the knowledge of how a manual installation and setup works we will look at ways to automate this task. In the morning we will learn how to automate installation and setup of software and in the afternoon how to automate the creation of cloud resources.

Before we begin make sure you have completed the steps in the [setup](./setup) page. If you have had difficulty with any part of them, now is the time to let us know and we will help you solve them.
