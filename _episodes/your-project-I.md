OUTLINE

Should have a list of projects in the event that students don't have their own. Probably also need a set of instructions for starting the project.

* Twitter scraper
* ether pad
* jupyter notebook
* mediawiki (I have a template for this) 
  * Maybe they could improve/modify it
* omeka
* islandora
* Spark+Hadoop for Big Data processing
* Globus endpoint for data transfer to cloud VM
*
