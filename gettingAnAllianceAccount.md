## Getting an Alliance account and cloud project

Getting an Alliance account and cloud project usually takes a few business days each. Ensuring you have an Alliance account and cloud project at least a week before the course begins is recommended as it can take some time to get these both setup. There are two steps to getting an Alliance Cloud project:

### 1. Get an Alliance account
To get an Alliance account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada or know someone who is that can sponsor your Alliance account. To get an Alliance account follow the instructions provided on this [Alliance page](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account).

### 2. Get an Alliance cloud project
Once you have an Alliance account, you (or the PI that sponsored you) will need to apply for a cloud project [here](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Cloud#Getting_a_Cloud_project).

Please request a **persistent** cloud project which is well suited to running web-services. If you are unsure about what cloud resources to request for the course, the minimum possible **persistent** cloud project you can request will be sufficient for the course. If more resources are required for your projects more can be requested later as needed or now if you are confident in your requirements.

If you aren't a PI but a sponsored user, you will also need to request to be added to your PI's cloud project, again using the same form linked from [here](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Cloud#Getting_a_Cloud_project).
