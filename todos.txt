Cloud course todo:
  1) move requirement for a CC cloud project to seperate page
  2) login info about VM and OpenStack project guest accounts
  3) post workshop survey needs to be mentioned in the first hour


- second SSh command to do watch? Maybe I should explore doing it in the background
